ANTH,H319,Deviant Bodies: The Anthropology of Gender and Race,"What is the relationship between white supremacy, racial capitalism, and the construction of gender difference, gender deviance, and racial hierarchy? How can we think about gender non-normativity as a challenge to racial capitalism and its regimes of value, while simultaneously recognizing the dangers of recuperating white gender nonconformity into the ruling racial regime? In this course, students will encounter scholars from a range of disciplines—anthropology, Black studies, history, performance studies, and comparative literature—exposing the colonial invention and imposition of race/sex difference as a foundational move of colonialism, transatlantic slavery, and capitalism. In the second half of the course, taking cues from Ferguson’s Aberrations in Black, Williamson’s Scandalize My Name, and McMillan’s Embodied Avatars, we will consider the (trans) liberation politics that coalesce through antinormative gendered positions refuting racial capitalism’s regimes of value.

In this class, we will turn our analytic gaze upon whiteness itself, exposing its insidious modes of self-and-other construction, and destabilizing its ocular power to define others. We will pay special attention to how the white, “colonial gaze” has operated in the purportedly-liberal discipline of anthropology, and explore ethnographic methods for studying whiteness and white supremacy.

ANTH,H328,The Fight Against Impunity: The Turn to International Criminal Prosecutions,"This course traces the conceptual shift or ‘turn’ towards individual criminal prosecutions for grave violations of human rights and humanitarian principles, the related conceptual shifts (from responsibility to individual accountability or from human rights reporting to evidence collection) and the international, national and regional organizations that are part of this turn. This is an interdisciplinary course offering students an introduction to the field of international criminal justice. Through a series of weekly ‘dossiers’, with readings drawn from a wide range of sources including academic literature, NGO reports, blog posts, Twitter threads and case law, we will explore the emergence of international criminal justice as a distinct field of practice and seek to uncover the underlying assumptions and principles that inform the field. This course will offer an introduction to international criminal law as a legal framework. At the same time, we will work to situate this legal framework within broader, interdisciplinary conversations and current affairs: justice and social repair, humanitarianism, the role of non-state actors and civil society, international development, the influence of technology and social media, etc.

BIOL,H457,Advanced Topics in Protein Science,"In the last decade great strides have been made in identifying protein misfolding and aggregation in a wide variety of debilitating human diseases. It is now becoming clear that many dementias and other signs of “old age” can now be attributed to these diseases, leading to a decrease in the quality of life. Thus, approaches to treat these diseases are of paramount importance for quality of life issues. In order to develop treatments, a molecular understanding of these diseases is critical. The underlying biophysical basis for protein misfolding and aggregation is now largely understood and involves a common structural motif called the cross-b-sheet fibril. This course will focus on a set of diseases for which we now know quite a lot about the chemistry, molecular biology, and cell biology that underlies the misfolding behavior of the protein in question. We will look at Alzheimer’s disease, prion infectious disease, Huntington’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and ALS or Lou Gehrig’s disease. While the course will focus on the primary literature that discusses the protein aggregation problem, other disciplinary areas such as genetics, cell biology, animal model systems, and clinical biology may be introduced as appropriate.

The hegemonic, patriarchal institution of the archive that constructs and perpetuates the canon and the master narratives of history while, marginalizing, silencing, and erasing the subaltern and the subcultural has been contested by the poststructuralist philosophers and critical theorists of the late 20 th and early 21 st century. A new concept of the archive transpired in the interdisciplinary fields of postcolonial, gender, cultural, and performance studies, one that is more utopian and more inclusive and is not limited by dominant repressive power structures and ideologies. This archive does not merely revisit the past to excavate the eradicated traces and silenced voices, but also, perhaps more importantly, opens the potential for a formerly unimaginable, and yet-to-be-imagined future.","A: Meaning, Interpretation (Texts)"

Our primary texts will be the works themselves: French chansons, Italian madrigals, Latin motets, and solo songs of the fifteenth through early seventeenth centuries. We will study poetry by Petrarch, Tasso, Christine de Pizan, Ronsard as interpreted by composers like Guillaume Dufay, Josquin Desprez, Cipriano de Rore, Orlandus Lassus, Luca Marenzio, Claudio Monteverdi (and plenty of others, too).

Depuis les trois dernières décennies, le verbe (et ses dérivés : migration, migrant) s’est « politisé », connotant désormais une situation de crise, aux frontières des États riches de la planète (de l’Europe notamment). Comment donc, dans un monde des nations nous déplaçons-nous aujourd’hui ? Comment respecter la souveraineté de celles-ci, l’intégrité de leurs frontières ? Comment reconnaître, au moins philosophiquement, le droit à la migration, à l’asile, bref à l’hospitalité envers l’étranger, le citoyen d’une autre nation ? Comment accorder l’idéal humaniste (et universel) de l’hospitalité à nos valeurs contemporaines liées à la citoyenneté ? Les textes au programme (essais – Agier, Arendt, Derrida, Kant –, textes littéraires – Claudel, Gaudé, Jelinek, Sacco – et films – Bories, Crialese, Falardeau, Kaurismäki, Lioret, Saleh-Haroun) nous aideront à réfléchir sur ces questions.

ENGL,H258,Desire and Domestic Fiction: The Development of the Novel in the 19th c.,"This course is designed as an introduction to the novel and to narrative theory in a trajectory loosely inscribed from the late 18th to the mid19th century, beginning with Richardson’s Pamela and culminating in George Eliot’s extraordinary and exemplary Middlemarch. These several novels propose both an epistemology—what we know—as well as an affective sensibility, or a structure of feeling, and we might question their purpose: to amuse, to entertain, certainly, but to educate, to compel, to convince us of a certain understanding of the world. As well, the course will look at the purchase of contemporary critical investments upon the act of reading itself or how reading is inflected through different models of critical and theoretical discourse: how narrative economies shape and determine the nature of our experience or what we can know of our experience; how narrative determines a subject ""self"" and how these selves are then transected by race, gender, class, and other social and political determinants; how narratives manage the less obvious and sublimated worlds of desire and the body's disruptions; how narratives negotiate the grotesque, the spectacular, and the sensational; and finally, how these variously constituted needs and desires become constructions of “textual knowledge”.","A: Meaning, Interpretation (Texts)"

This course will begin with an exploration of the literary achievements of BAM, and then move into contemporary literature and culture, charting the influence of the era. Among others, we will consider the following questions: do contemporary black artists think of themselves as participating in a nationalist movement of any kind? How do they portray and theorize African American identity? For whom do they write and with whom are they fighting? The requirements for this course are several short and informal response papers and three formal essays ranging from 5-10pp.","A: Meaning, Interpretation (Texts)"

FREN,H102,Introduction a l'analyse litteraire et culturelle II,"The goal of this course, the sequel to French 101, is to continue to develop your powers of expression and analysis in French. A difference between French 102 and 105 (the other sequel to 101) is that here the objects of study will be literary, and that through them we will consider what the value of studying literature is. In French and Francophone cultures, literature has an important and volatile relation to the question of civilization. The relation is important because literature has been used to define and to instill a sense of civility, that is, what it takes for people to live peacefully with one another. On the other hand, the relation is volatile because people disagree about literature's role in defining civility as well as about how to define civility (and therefore civilization) itself. We will explore these fundamental issues in French and Francophone cultures through texts and films of diverse periods, genres, and origins. Authors and artists will include Marivaux, Abdellatif Kechiche, Jean de La Fontaine, Victor Hugo, Françoise de Graffigny, Michel de Montaigne, and Patrick Chamoiseau.

In addition to the basic text and review of grammar, readings are chosen from newspapers, contemporary literary texts, magazines, and they are complemented by video materials. Offered in the second semester.

FREN,H202,Rêves d'empire et Renaissance française,"Pendant sa Renaissance (d'environ 1500 à 1600) la France n'avait pas l'empire qu'elle aurait plus tard. Néanmoins, cette période représente un point tournant dans l'histoire de la vision impériale française—ainsi que de la critique de cette vision. Ce cours juxtapose le rêve de fonder un empire géo-politique et le programme culturel de la Renaissance. Nous verrons deux ambitions comme étroitement liées: 1) celle de transformer la France d'une ancienne colonie (de l'Empire romain) en le centre de son propre empire; et 2) celle de transmettre la Renaissance d'Italie en France. Nous étudierons une série de projets littéraires, artistiques et architecturaux qui manifestent non seulement cette fusion de culture et d'impérialisme, mais aussi sa mise en question. (Les auteurs de ces projets sont François Rabelais, Geoffroy Tory, Joachim Du Bellay, Marguerite de Navarre, Michel de Montaigne, et Léonard da Vinci, entre autres). Cette expérience nous permettra de mettre en perspective historique la pratique du colonialisme et post-colonialisme français des siècles suivants. In French.

FREN,H203,Théâtre et raison d'état en France au grand siècle,"What makes a culture ""great""? A good place to explore this question is 17th-century France. It is often thought that during this century, French culture became great—hence the century's nickname, le grand siècle. In this course we will consider the hypothesis of French grandeur, but not to assess it as true or false. Rather, we will approach it as a notion that gets constructed, applied, and interrogated in the 1600s through a series of theatrical, political, architectural, theological, and scientific œuvres. These works—mainly by Molière, Madame de Lafayette, Racine, La Bruyère, Corneille, Descartes, Elisabeth de Bohême, and André Le Nôtre—differ radically in their ideas, forms, perspectives, and effects. Nevertheless, they are all regarded in France as ""classics"" in that they serve in the classroom as essential ingredients of an education. The significance of this class, therefore, extends beyond the specific period it covers to include French culture in general and the values that it may (or may not) have today. We will pay particular attention to theatrical plays as objects of individual passion and political appropriation, to the place of women with respect to ideologies of state and reason, to the establishment of a centralized––i.e., modern––state, as represented through the palace of Versailles and its gardens.

We will begin with an overview of the history and critique of French imperialism, talk about economic, political, ideological and psychological foundations of the colonial enterprise, and then study the films. These materials offer complex and sometimes divergent views on colonization but from their confrontation should arise not only a general but also a critical understanding of colonization and its repercussions.

Comment donc, dans un monde des nations nous déplaçons-nous aujourd’hui ? Comment respecter la souveraineté de celles-ci, l’intégrité de leurs frontières ? Comment reconnaître, au moins philosophiquement, le droit à la migration, à l’asile, bref à l’hospitalité envers l’étranger, le citoyen d’une autre nation ? Comment accorder l’idéal humaniste (et universel) de l’hospitalité à nos valeurs contemporaines liées à la citoyenneté ? Les textes au programme (essais – Agier, Arendt, Derrida, Kant –, textes littéraires – Claudel, Gaudé, Jelinek, Sacco – et films – Bories, Crialese, Falardeau, Kaurismäki, Lioret, Saleh-Haroun) nous aideront à réfléchir sur ces questions.

GERM,H210,The City of Brotherly Love - Immigration and Images of a Changing City,"The course will engage with the history of Philadelphia as an immigrant city and look at the ways in which the different neighborhoods have changed over time. More specifically, it will highlight aspects of Philadelphia’s early German-speaking community, which made up about 45% of the city’s total residents in 1760 and about 33% in 1800 (Minardi). For example, Germantown, Brewerytown, and Olney were at some point primarily German-speaking neighborhoods, which then became primarily African-American, and in the case of Olney, Asian-American. Our analysis would scrutinize how the city demographically and visually transformed by looking at different maps, images, paintings etc. Furthermore, the course would also explore what attracted the various populations to the city at different historic times. In collaboration with HIAS, StoriesthatLive and Puentes de Salud, we would study how European Jews and Latin-Americans found refuge in the city of brotherly love. Initially, the Pennsylvania German Society of Philadelphia was also created in 1764, to help German speaking immigrants in need. Students will create a short film project about a person, who chose to immigrate to and found home in Philadelphia. Moreover, the course would touch on how the different populations perceived each other at different historic moments. For example, German speaking people often took on a mediating role between Native Americans and Anglo-Saxons in the early years of the United States. Our course materials would consist of a mix of biographical, historical, literary and art material. The course, which will be taught in English, is open to both German and non-German speakers. There will be an extra session in German for students taking it for German credit. This class will be taught in Philadelphia as part of the Tri-Co Philly Program

In addition to their humor, however, these plays also give us access to parts of Roman life sometimes missing from the great works of Latin literature: they show us immigrants and the enslaved, sex workers and poor soldiers, young people falling in love, parents worrying about their children, siblings and friends negotiating difficult relationships. Plautus, moreover, is the earliest Roman author whose works survive intact; Terence is Latin's earliest African author, and one of the few enslaved Roman authors whose writings we can read today.
Prerequisite(s): Two semesters of 100-level Latin, or instructor consent","A: Meaning, Interpretation (Texts)"
LATN,H350,Seminar in Latin Literature: Postclassicisms: Flavian/Late Antique/Renaissance,"This seminar will explore the concept of the “postclassical” and how subsequent authors engage “classical” authors, genres, works, and ideas. We will focus on three distinctive moments in which secondariness emerged as a formative element of aesthetic and intellectual programs: the Flavian period, Late Antiquity (broadly conceived), and the Renaissance (southern and northern). We will consider the configuration and transmission of classical canons and how these spurred envy, anxiety, rivalry, innovation, and (mis)/(re)interpretation (among other creative responses)—as well as the role that postclassical moments played in the construction of the classical. Alongside our collective investigation of a specific text or genre (likely one in prose and one in verse), students will have the opportunity to trace the iterative reception of an author, idea, or genre through these three epochs. Most of the work in the course will be Latin; but there will some opportunities, for those so inclined, to look to Greek as well.

At the same time, we will work to situate this legal framework within broader, interdisciplinary conversations and current affairs: justice and social repair, humanitarianism, the role of non-state actors and civil society, international development, the influence of technology and social media, etc.

Inheritance is unique, as Kant notes, as a transfer or gift that typically cannot be refused.

By examining theories of how inheritances proceed across and through individuals and groups, especially via relations thought inheritably impotent (e.g., race and queerness), we will contemplate these movements as ethical genealogies, that is, as historical transfers of value (economic, social, dispositional) that configure recognition of our embodied selves.","A: Meaning, Interpretation (Texts)"

To what extent can community-based organizations and public interest groups alter long-standing policies, practices, and institutions in a large, American city like Philadelphia? To what extent are their efforts impeded by well-established interests and structural forces rooted in race, ethnicity, class, and culture? How have recent societal shifts affected underlying tensions between Old Philadelphia and New Philadelphia? We will explore who wins and who loses in the political arena through a series of case studies of key policy issues that are highly salient to the people of Philadelphia, including criminal justice reform, immigrants’ rights, gentrification and affordable housing, urban development, and workforce diversity. How these policy issues are resolved will reveal much about the nature of power and whether the source of that power springs from the bottom-up or remains primarily a top-down phenomenon.

WRPR,H110,Medical Narratives,"Attention to literature and the arts helps to develop and nurture skills of observation, analysis, empathy, and self-reflection––skills that are essential for humane medical care,” suggests Felice Aull (a founder of the Literature, Arts, and Medicine Database). This course is designed to foster such skills, but it will do so by turning our very notion of “humane medical care” into an object for reflection and analysis. Our exploration of texts will admit uncertainty about what degrees of empathy, self-reflection, or indeed humaneness are reachable. Do communications about illness offer us a special route to knowledge of the self, whether our own or someone else’s? Do they induce detachment even as they summon empathy? (Do “clinical tales” inevitably prompt us to feel, in the words of Oliver Sacks, like “an anthropologist on Mars”?) Reading across a broad spectrum of fiction and nonfiction works, we will take a clinical view of medical story-telling itself. What linguistic strategies do various medical narratives employ? What are the texts’ apparent purposes? Are there therapeutic effects to be found in writing or reading narratives of illness––and, if so, by whom: the patient? the medical professional? the third-party observer? Using close reading as our primary tool, we will explore quandaries of personhood in the context of health struggles.

WRPR,H140,The Rhetoric of Argument,"In this course students will learn how to analyze arguments, compose arguments of their own, and write clear, concise, and elegant prose. The first half of the course will relate principles of argument and composition to principles of textual analysis. A good reader can analyze the logic of an argument, the style of its presentation, and the way it solicits its audience. Similarly, the good writer understands her audience, adopts a style appropriate to the situation, and crafts an argument that establishes grounds for possible agreement. A good writer is a better reader. For example, in Act II, scene ii of Hamlet Polonius wastes time while saying he won't: ""since brevity is the soul of wit / And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes / I will be brief"" He can't even speak briefly of brevity but follows his aphorism with a redundant flourish of his own. Like Polonius, when you present your reader with tedious prose you present yourself as tedious. And though few occasions warrant such a presentation, this course will supply students with the power to suit their words to different occasions and the power to read how others in turn both craft themselves and either succeed or fail to convince.The second half of the course will consider the relation between experience and language, between our world and our words. Using the analytic tools assembled during the first half, we will examine works of philosophy and literature that seek to define this relation. Texts will include, Plato's Gorgias, Friedrich Nietzsche's early essay, ""On Truth and Lying in an Extra-moral Sense,"" and Toni Morrison's novel, Sula. We will evaluate these works on the basis of their claims about language and on the basis of the language of these claims.

WRPR,H156,Good Guys & Gals? Quaker Imagery in Fiction,"What have been the literary uses of Quaker ideas and images in fiction? How have these changed over time? Here on the Haverford campus, with its Quaker heritage and traditions, is housed perhaps the largest collection of Quaker novels anywhere in the world, fiction by or about Quakers, often populated with characters whose Quakerliness is designed to evoke a certain mood, message, or subtext. For some authors, Quakers became stand-ins for virtue. For others, the Quaker image is of the troublemaker, the nay-sayer, the haughty, unbending zealot. In this course we will read excerpts from an array of Quaker fiction. Then, through class discussions, written essays, and through considering each others writing, students will explore how commentators have interpreted the meaning of ""Quakerness"" in literature.""

WRPR,H159,Gender and Sexuality in Islamic Texts and Practices,"This course introduces students to the different views of gender and sexuality in Islamic thought, and situates these views within Muslim histories and societies. We will draw on primary sources, historiographical work, ethnographies of Muslim societies, fiction, poetry, and play. One major focus will be on homosexuality in Islam and Muslim societies. In the course of this examination we will also have a chance to question what “homosexuality” is and whether this term can be applied cross-culturally and cross-religiously. To think critically about homosexuality in Islam will thus compel us to reconsider homosexuality and Islam at once. Open only to first-year students as assigned by the Director of College Writing.

WRPR,H160,"Borders, Walls and Bridges: Cultural Approaches to Divided Cities","Urban spaces are sites of dynamic connection, but may also be defined by their established boundaries. Walls and fences are just some of the forms of demarcation; legacies of inequality also forcefully structure cities. From Berlin to Birmingham, modern history is rife with examples of urban segregation that is both architecturally built and socially inscribed. The daily life of a city includes zones of separation influenced by race, gender, sexuality, and class, while interaction across and within transnational cultural spaces remaps our understandings of global borders. Further, the expanding prison industrial complex is another prominent example of internal division in which narratives of freedom and repression are jointly expressed. But even with histories of struggle, cities continue to be ideal locales from which to transform communities, where individuals can work across lines of difference and pursue collective grassroots projects. Digital tools designed for cityscapes also offer new ways to explore and revise legacies of division. This writing course will approach the topic of divided cities through a range of interdisciplinary cultural approaches and comparative 20th- and 21st-century case studies. Our course readings include selections from such works as Carl Nightengale s Segregation: A World History of Divided Cities, Teresa Caldeira s City of Walls, Ruth Gilmore s Golden Gulag, Michael Katz s Why Don t American Cities Burn, and Peter Schneider s Wall Jumper. In addition to regular writing assignments, our class will take several class field trips to sites in Philadelphia, with the city serving as one of our primary sources for this course.

What kinds of language are stigmatized and what kinds are deemed “correct” or socially powerful, and why? In what ways is language inherently political--i.e. embedded within and constituent of unequal power relations--and how might we choose to navigate the implications of our language use? How might language be a tool for inclusion or empowerment for marginalized communities, or a tool for seeking social justice?
